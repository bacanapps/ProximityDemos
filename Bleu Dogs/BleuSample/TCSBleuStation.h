/**
 A TCSBleuStation represents a Bleu Station and is the interface to reading and
 writing values to a blue station from an iOS device. Objects of class
 TCSBleuStation are created by a TCSBleuStationManager object.
 
There are two ways to access
 the properties of a Bleu Station: synchronously, using properties, and
 asynchronously, using a delegate.
 
 **Asynchronous Reads**
 
 An asynchronous read will always trigger Bluetooth to read from the
 Blue Station, so you are guaranteed the latest information. The method
 
    - (void)readValues:(NSArray *)values;
 
 will communicate with the Bleu Station over Bluetooth. When the Bleu Station
 returns the result, either with the value or with an error, the corresponding
 delegate method is called.
 
     â€“ station:didReadValues:error:
 
 **Synchronous Read via Propertiies**
 
 Once a TCSBleuStation object has retrieved values from a Bleu Station, those
 values are accessible via properties. All properties in a TCSBleuStation should
 be considered cached copies of the result of the last asynchronous read. If a
 Bleu Station hasn't read a given property yet, the property will return nil. In
 this case a call to the asynchronous method is required.
 
 Reading and writing
 to a Blue Station is a high latency operation which impacts battery life, so
 values are not read by default. If you expect you'll need access to all the properties
 (for example, for a master-detail interface), you can issue an asynchronous read
 for the property TCSBleuStationAllProperties. That will read all values from the
 station, store the cached values, and make them available via properties.
 
 **Writing Values**
 
 All object properties are read-only. The only way to write to a Bleu Station is using
 the asynchronous write call `- (void)writeValues:(NSDictionary *)values;`. See
 above for the keys for each of the properties properties.
 
 **The hardwareName Property**
 
 The hardwareName is unique in two ways:
 
 1. It available prior to any asynchronous read.
 1. It is based on the MAC adddress, and can be used to idenify a Bleu Station
 
 In deploying Bleu Stations, you can identify a station using the hardwareName,
 then write a set of appropriate values, all without issuing a single
 asynchronous read.

 **Authentication**
 
 Before writing any values you must authenticate with the Bleu Station. Calling
 authenticateWithPassword: will trigger a Bluetooth pairing dialog on the device.
 This sets up an encrypted connection before the password is sent to the station.
 
 **Constants**
 
 In addition to the enumerations documented in TCSBleuStationErrorCode, there are
 several string constants documented in the header file. These are for accessing
 addtional information from the userInfo dictionary included in the NSError
 objects.

 there might be multiple delegate calls. Write calls including the key
 TCSBleuStationAllProperties will return an error for that key. Other keys included
 in the _values_ will proceed to write.
 
 The type for each key is same as the related property type. For example, the type
 of the proximityUUID property is NSString; the type of the value for key
 TCSBleuStationProximityUUID is an NSString. All value types for BleuStations are
 supported by plists. This makes it easy to configure a station using a set of
 values retrieved from a plist, from a JSON object, or other archived formats.
